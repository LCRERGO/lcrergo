Hi, I'm Dante, I am a software developer that sometimes messes around with
retro computing and the theory of programming languages. Also, I'm always
trying to poke around into areas outside of my current knowledge, such as
info-sec and computer graphics.

You may find strange that I don't use those fancy graphics in here, but
that's because pretty much any language you can imagine I have already
messed with, even those that are not used often, so I prefer to let this
information out of my profile.
